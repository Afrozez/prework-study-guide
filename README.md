# <Prework Study Guide>

## The Prework study guide provided some hands on practice creating a webpage displaying helpful notes we learned on the way.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation is to provide for my wife/child.
- I built this project to have hands on experience using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- When I am stuck on something I can look back on this project for some basic notes.
- I learned how to better understand the dynamics behind for loops and also a bunch of information on how to use the terminal and/or github to keep stuff organized.

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
